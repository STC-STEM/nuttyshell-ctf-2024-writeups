## Explaination 

Basically a kind of uri(?) injection

On the second time uploading `sleep.zip`, it throws a `Directory is already exists` exception before `sleep.zip` is unlink, so `sleep.zip` is kept under `uploads` directory

![](./img/5.png)

When `sleep.zip#i.zip` is uploaded. the server will concat the zip uri as `zip://./uploads/sleep.zip#i.zip#idk.php` which means `i.zip#idk.php` under `sleep.zip`

Therefore, the file `sleep.zip` -> `i.zip#idk.php` is extracted instead of `sleep.zip#i.zip` -> `idk.php` <br/>
The file is then copied to `uploads/sleep.zip#i/idk.php`

Then there is a file `asdf` that doesnt exist in `sleep.zip`, so the server throws an `Unzip failed!` exception before the php files are unlinked.

Then visit the corresponding url to access the shell php file `idk.php`, done

Actually I dont need to do the above stuffs. ðŸ˜° <br/>
What I need is just construct a zip file in this layout...:

1. web-shell.php
2. [CORRUPTED FILE ENTRY]

Wasting time againðŸ˜°
